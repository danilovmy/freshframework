Test deno fresh framework

AST Advanced Sales Technologies GmbH
Task: Create a small single-page Real-time Chat Application where anonymous
users can send messages to a shared text board without prior registration.
Requirements:
● The application should be containerized using Docker.
● Use a NoSQL database to store the sent messages.
● Use Denoland’s Fresh framework and any other libraries of your choice.
● The application should be able to handle multiple users sending messages
simultaneously.
● Use GitHub for development, with regular commits to show progress.
● Use GitHub Actions to automatically lint the code on push.
Deliverables:
● A working Docker container with the application.
● Source code for the application, hosted on a public GitHub repository with a
commit history showing progress.
● A brief documentation on how to run the application and any design decisions
made.
Good luck!😊
